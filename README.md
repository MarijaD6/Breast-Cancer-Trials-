This project applies EfficientNetB5 deep learning architecture for the classification of breast cancer histopathological images into benign and malignant categories.
It is based on the BreaKHis dataset, which is widely used for benchmarking breast cancer classification research. The project includes data preprocessing, augmentation, training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

The dataset used is BreaKHis: 
Description: The dataset contains 7,909 images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients.
Magnifications: Each image was acquired at different optical zoom levels: 40X, 100X, 200X, 400X.

Classes:
Benign tumors (2,480 images, 4 subtypes: adenosis, fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, tubular adenoma)
Malignant tumors (5,429 images, 4 subtypes: ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, papillary carcinoma)
